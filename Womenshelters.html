    <h2> Shelters</h2>
    <p>Women shelters is a way to help women escape a dangerous situation that can be domestic violence and intimate partners violence. They offer temporary refuge, support and other service to help women and their kids to move forward like legal guidance and counselling. </p>

    <p>Most of the times women cannot escape an abusive environment because they don’t have the means to do that. Shelters try to provide these kind of means, especially economical support. Also, a woman can regain control over her life in these shelters, escaping an impossible situation.</p> 
    <br>

    <p><strong>Other services</strong> that can be offered are: 1) an education program, 2) a crisis hotline, 3) psychological counselling to overcome the trauma for both women abused and their children. They also provide counselling, classes to help women to become independent acquiring new skills and suppor groups if they want to talk to other women who were in similar situations. Very important are legal and medical advocacy provided by these shelters. </p>
